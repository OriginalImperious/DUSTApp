public enum ENUM_Service_Types {
	
	// When a player wishes to hire a skilled craftsman, cartographer, mercenary, or any type of specialist
	// for any reason, that specialist will ask for compensation. That compensation can be made in various
	// ways, including remunerative payments, favors, resources, etc. This enumeration will list the types of 
	// hirelings available for players to engage, as well as allow the player to devise a reasonable offer
	// for services should they wish to hire on, or hire themselves out as, specialists. Since there is no
	// overarching monetary systems in place in the world of Dust, each service type has a given value per unit
	// that should be balanced against the service type being asked.
